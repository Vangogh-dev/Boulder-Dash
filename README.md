# Boulder Dash â€“ Java Game Project

Welcome to my Java-based recreation of the classic NES game **Boulder Dash**! ðŸŽ®  
This project was developed as part of an academic assignment, with the goal of reimagining the original game's mechanics using object-oriented programming and modern software design principles.

##  Project Overview

Boulder Dash is a maze-based puzzle game where players navigate underground caves, collect diamonds, and avoid hazards like falling rocks and enemies. My version aims to capture the nostalgic feel of the original while showcasing the structure and features of a well-organized Java application.

## ðŸ›  Built With

- **Java** â€“ Main programming language used to build the game
- **PostgreSQL** â€“ For handling and persisting game data
- **UML & Visual Paradigm** â€“ For planning out the applicationâ€™s structure
- **Eclipse IDE** â€“ Used for development (setup guide included)

##  What's Inside

- `src/` â€“ All the Java source code for the game
- `database.sql` â€“ SQL schema to initialize the PostgreSQL database
- `diagram.png` & `diagram.vpp` â€“ UML class diagrams for better understanding of the architecture
- `eclipse_tuto.pdf` â€“ A quick guide to setting up the project in Eclipse

##  Features

- Recreated core mechanics from the original Boulder Dash game
- Tile-based movement and real-time game updates
- Entity-based system for rocks, diamonds, player, and enemies
- Database integration to store levels and game data
